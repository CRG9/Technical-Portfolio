              One opportunity players on Atomix had was the ability to acquire
              resources, upgrade their mining gear, and gain access to new mines
              on the server.
            </li>
            <li>
              Levels were climbed by mining blocks and earning progress until
              reaching ever increasing progress requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              In doing so, players gained access to new powerups and upgrades
              that helped them climb levels faster and become a true competitor
              on the server.

          <h3>Level Up Cost Calculations</h3>
          <ol>
          <li>
            Considering the MMO nature of the game, a smooth leveling curve required the accounting for numerous factors that players faced on their journies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to the importance of maintaining a smooth feel for progression
            through the game, we needed to create a curve comprised of curves that accurately reflected a player's power and leveling ability at different stages of the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating this curve-comprised-of-curves turned out to be extremely effective
            at accomplishing our desired end result!

              Seen below are the final calculations that made up our level
              progresion curve.
            </li>
            <li>
              You'll notice that the first few levels are not dictated by a
              calculation, where as the latter are defined explicitly by a
              formula.
            </li>
            <li>
              This is by design! The early levels are meant to hook the player,
              where as the latter levels are meant to provide the challenge.

              After a player gained enough progress, a level up action
              automatically occured.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each level gave access to currencies, unlocks, and new abilities
              that propelled the player forward in the game.
