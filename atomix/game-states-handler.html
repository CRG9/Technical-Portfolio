                  <p>
                     Atomix offered the opportunity for interplay between the levels
                     framework and the tiers framework.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Through Temples, players were given the ability to capture temple
                     territories to then be granted access to their valuable mines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Better mines = more progress = higher leveling ability, but only if
                     they have the PvP accumen to stay in the fight!

                  <h2>Temple Gamestates Code</h2>
                  <p>Working through the logic and accounting for all of the possible scenarios that would play out took several dozen hours and touched the hands of multiple developers.</p>
                  <p>This project in particular taught me the importance of having developers write clean, readable, and well documented code so that future teammates can work on it effectively (and with less pain...)</p>
                  <p>When it was all said and done, not only did we have a working state machine, but we also had the ability to trigger certain states with administrative commands without breaking the game.</p>
