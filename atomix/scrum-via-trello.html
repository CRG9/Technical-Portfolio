          <h2>Running Scrum for Atomix</h2>
          <p>
            Scrum was a fundamental breakthrough our team experienced in our
            developmental efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to using Trello, we had a groupchat where I would assign tasks
            to the developers and<br />
            would work through bugs/testing all in one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually the volume of projects we worked on along with the
            complexity of systems and bugs required a smoother system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, my developers were able to point us in the right
            direction - that's where Scrum began!
          </p>
