                    <h3>Bracket Handler</h3>
                    <p>To ensure sound, error free bracket handling, I led our team
                       in manual QA to hunt out bugs and account for all possible
                       scenarios that would break the bracket.

                       <ul>
                           <p>Some examples included:</p>
                           - A player leaving the server while in the tournament.
                           <br>- A player being banned from the server while in the tournament.
                           <br>- A player disconnecting then rejoining the server while in a tournament.
                       </ul>
